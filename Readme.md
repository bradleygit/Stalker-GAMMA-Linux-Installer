# S.T.A.L.K.E.R. GAMMA Linux Installer & Updater (Proton + Mod Organizer 2)

This script automates the installation and updating of **S.T.A.L.K.E.R. GAMMA** on Linux.  
It sets up Proton, configures a Wine prefix, installs Anomaly, the GAMMA modpack, and Mod Organizer 2, and creates both a Lutris entry and a desktop shortcut.  
It supports fast updates without reinstalling Proton or recreating the prefix, and uses resumable high-speed downloads for efficiency.

## Features

- First-run Proton version selection, saved for future runs  
- Proton installation via SteamCMD if needed  
- Wine prefix creation and configuration with required runtime libraries  
- Automated installation of [gamma-launcher](https://github.com/Mord3rca/gamma-launcher) and the GAMMA modpack  
- Automatic download and configuration of Mod Organizer 2 (portable)  
- Lutris configuration for easy launching  
- Desktop shortcut creation  
- High-speed resumable downloads using `aria2c` (falls back to `wget`)

## Troubleshooting

- Install any missing dependencies with your package manager:  
```bash
sudo apt install git wget curl steam aria2   # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo pacman -S git wget curl steam aria2     # Arch
```
## Slow or unstable downloads
- Install aria2 to enable multi-connection downloads:
```bash
sudo apt install aria2    # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo pacman -S aria2      # Arch
```
  
## Slow or unstable downloads
- Install aria2 to enable multi-connection downloads:
```bash
rm -rf ~/StalkerGAMMA
./stalker-gamma-install
```
## Lutris entry is missing

- Re-run the script without the update flag to recreate the Lutris configuration
